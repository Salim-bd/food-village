            <h3> Dr. Zara </h3>
            <p> Healthy foods are good for health. When we intake healthy fruits and vegetables that are full of
                nutrients, we reduce the chances of diseases. For instance, green vegetables help us to maintain
                strength and vigor. In addition, certain healthy food items keep away long-term illnesses like diabetes
                and blood pressure. </p>
